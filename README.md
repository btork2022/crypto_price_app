# <Crypto Price Viewer Application>

## Description

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It is a React.js built application designed for the purpose of easy viewing access to current cryptocurrency prices. Compared to multi-page versions of web applications built on CSS-javascript, this single-page version is for giving users faster access to information due to the quick page loading feature of React.js.
